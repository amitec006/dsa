    /**
     * Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
     * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
     *
     * Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
     * NOTE:
     * 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
     * 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
     *
     * Return the ans % 10000003.
     *
     * Input Format
     *
     * The first argument given is the integer A.
     * The second argument given is the integer B.
     * The third argument given is the integer array C.

     * Return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board % 10000003.
