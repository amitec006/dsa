    /**
     * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the smallest missing positive number using:
     *
     * O(n) time
     *
     * O(1) extra space (modify the array in-place)
     *
     * üß† Key Idea
     * We want each positive number x (in range 1 to N, where N is the length of the array) to be at index x - 1.
     *
     * Why?
     * Because:
     *
     * If all positive integers from 1 to N are present, then they will occupy indices 0 to N-1.
     *
     * The first number that doesn't appear at its correct position tells us the smallest missing positive.
     *
     * üîÅ Step-by-Step Algorithm
     * Step 1: Rearrange elements
     * Loop through the array:
     *
     * For each number A[i], while it is in the range 1 to N, and it's not already at its correct position (A[i] != A[A[i] - 1]), swap it with the number at its target position.
     *
     * This moves every valid positive number to its correct place.
     *
     * Step 2: Scan for the missing number
     * After the rearrangement, scan the array:
     *
     * If at index i, A[i] != i + 1, then return i + 1 as the missing number.
     *
     * If all numbers are in correct place (A[i] == i + 1), then the missing number is N + 1.
